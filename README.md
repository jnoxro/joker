# Joker

Joker is an OCR engine created with the focus of high speed on low performance systems

Current tests on an Intel® Pentium(R) CPU N3710 @ 1.60GHz × 4 processor result in a single threaded OCR time of ~275 microseconds (0.275 milliseconds, 0.000275 seconds) for a library size of 26 characters using the PixelAveraging OCR method.
